This project aims to simulate the process of MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) on Ethereum blockchain.

1. The simulation executes a function simulateMevDefault and another simulateMevNormalized function.

2. The number of validator nodes and their categories are:
Categories	Ethers	Total
Whale	6,000	3
Shark	3,000	5
Dolphin	600	8
Fish	300	13
Octopu	60	21
Crab	6	34
Shrimp	1	55

3. Additionally, there will be 1000 more accounts with ETH balance ranging from 0.1 to 1000 (normally distributed). These account will generate random transactions.

4. A local Ganache node will be deployed using Docker containers to perform the simulation.

5. The project will use Spring boot + Maven

6. A separate BlockchainUtil.java class will provide all functions required to interact with the Ganache node.

7. There should be moderate unit testing against the source code.
